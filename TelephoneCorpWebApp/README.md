This is my first experience with java servlets and jsp pages. The database that was used was mysql working on sqlworkbench. I successfully built the whole project using the MVC model (Model-view-controller), following a business model. That project gave me knowledge and starting basic experience to work to bigger, more organised and completed web projects. Documentation in greek but a simple app structure diagram is a png file with text in english.
